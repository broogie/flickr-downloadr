- Currently the Model View Presenter architectural pattern is being used. Please ensure that is adhered to.
- In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. 
- Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality.
- Ensure that local build that compiles and runs all the unit tests (invoked with `./build/go.bat`) passes.
